# Platform Engineering Copilot - Agent Guide

> Comprehensive documentation for all specialized AI agents in the Platform Engineering Copilot

## Overview

The Platform Engineering Copilot uses a **multi-agent orchestration architecture** where specialized AI agents coordinate to handle complex infrastructure, compliance, cost management, and operational tasks. Each agent is an expert in its domain with dedicated plugins, system prompts, and capabilities.

### Architecture

```
User Query → Orchestrator Agent → Specialized Agents → Response

    Sequential            Parallel
    Execution            Execution
```

**Key Features:**
- **Intelligent Routing**: Orchestrator analyzes intent and routes to appropriate agents
- **Shared Memory**: Agents share context, files, and results across the conversation
- **Plugin Architecture**: Each agent has specialized plugins for domain-specific operations
- **Azure Integration**: Direct integration with Azure services via MCP Server and Azure SDK

## 🔀 Agent Orchestration

### Orchestrator Agent

The **OrchestratorAgent** is the "brain" of the multi-agent system. It analyzes user queries, creates execution plans, and coordinates specialized agents.

**Responsibilities:**
1. **Intent Analysis**: Determine primary intent (infrastructure, compliance, cost, etc.)
2. **Execution Planning**: Create sequential or parallel task plans
3. **Agent Selection**: Route tasks to appropriate specialized agents
4. **Result Aggregation**: Combine results from multiple agents
5. **Error Handling**: Retry logic and fallback strategies

**Execution Patterns:**
- **Sequential**: Tasks must complete in order (e.g., deploy → scan → document)
- **Parallel**: Independent tasks run concurrently (e.g., cost analysis + inventory)

### Intent Keywords

The orchestrator uses keyword matching to route requests:

| Intent | Keywords |
|--------|----------|
| **Infrastructure** | provision, deploy, create resource, bicep, terraform, arm template, network, topology, aks, vm, storage |
| **Compliance** | compliance, nist, 800-53, ato, emass, security, vulnerability, scan, control, assessment |
| **Cost** | cost, estimate, price, budget, spend, optimize, savings, forecast |
| **Environment** | environment, clone, scale, lifecycle, blue-green, canary, staging, production |
| **Discovery** | list, find, discover, inventory, show, resources, dependency, orphaned, tags |
| **Document** | document, diagram, architecture, runbook, ssp, sar, sap, procedure, policy |

### Shared Memory

Agents use **SharedMemory** to share context, files, and results:

```csharp
// Store file for later retrieval
memory.StoreFile(conversationId, "template.bicep", bicepContent);

// Retrieve file in another agent
var template = memory.GetFile(conversationId, "template.bicep");

// Store metadata
memory.StoreMetadata(conversationId, "deploymentId", deploymentId);
```

**Use Cases:**
- InfrastructureAgent generates Bicep → EnvironmentAgent deploys it
- ComplianceAgent scans resources → DocumentAgent generates SSP
- DiscoveryAgent finds resources → CostManagementAgent analyzes costs

---

## Configuration

### Agent Registry (appsettings.json)

```json
{
  "AgentConfiguration": {
    "InfrastructureAgent": {
      "Enabled": true
    },
    "ComplianceAgent": {
      "Enabled": true
    },
    "CostManagementAgent": {
      "Enabled": true
    },
    "EnvironmentAgent": {
      "Enabled": true
    },
    "DiscoveryAgent": {
      "Enabled": true
    },
    "KnowledgeBaseAgent": {
      "Enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent-Specific Configuration

Each agent can be configured with:
- **Temperature**: Creativity level (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)
- **MaxTokens**: Response length limit
- **Plugins**: Enabled plugin list
- **DefaultSubscriptionId**: Azure subscription to use

---

## Usage Examples

### Multi-Agent Workflows

**Example 1: Deploy and Validate**
```
User: "Deploy a web app with database and run compliance scan"

Orchestrator:
  Task 1: InfrastructureAgent → Deploy resources
  Task 2: ComplianceAgent → Scan deployed resources
  Task 3: DocumentAgent → Generate documentation
```

**Example 2: Cost-Optimized Environment**
```
User: "Create a dev environment and analyze costs"

Orchestrator:
  Parallel:
    - EnvironmentAgent → Create environment
    - CostManagementAgent → Estimate costs
  Sequential:
    - CostManagementAgent → Optimization recommendations
```

**Example 3: ATO Package**
```
User: "Prepare FedRAMP ATO package for production"

Orchestrator:
  Task 1: DiscoveryAgent → Inventory resources
  Task 2: ComplianceAgent → Run NIST 800-53 scan
  Task 3: DocumentAgent → Generate SSP
  Task 4: DocumentAgent → Generate SAR
  Task 5: AtoPreparationAgent → Create POA&M
  Task 6: AtoPreparationAgent → Package for eMASS
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding

```bash
# Check agent configuration
cat appsettings.json | grep -A 5 "AgentConfiguration"

# Review logs
docker logs platform-engineering-copilot-mcp | grep "Agent initialized"
```

### Wrong Agent Selected

The orchestrator may route to wrong agent if intent is unclear. Be specific:

❌ "Check my stuff" → Unclear intent
✅ "Run NIST compliance scan on rg-prod" → Clear intent (ComplianceAgent)

### Plugin Errors

```bash
# Verify plugin registration
docker logs platform-engineering-copilot-mcp | grep "Registered.*Plugin"

# Check Azure credentials
az account show
```

---

## Development

### Creating a New Agent

1. **Define Agent Interface**
   ```csharp
   public class MyCustomAgent : ISpecializedAgent
   {
       public AgentType AgentType => AgentType.Custom;
       
       public async Task<AgentResponse> ProcessAsync(AgentTask task, SharedMemory memory)
       {
           // Implementation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create Plugin**
   ```csharp
   public class CustomPlugin
   {
       [KernelFunction("custom_operation")]
       [Description("Performs custom operation")]
       public async Task<string> PerformOperation(string input)
       {
           // Implementation
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Register in DI Container**
   ```csharp
   services.AddSingleton<ISpecializedAgent, MyCustomAgent>();
   ```

4. **Update AgentType Enum**
   ```csharp
   public enum AgentType
   {
       // ... existing types
       Custom
   }
   ```
