# Compliance Agent Test Suite

**Last Updated:** November 13, 2025  
**Agent:** Compliance  
**Plugin Functions:** 17 total  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing of all Compliance Agent capabilities

## 📋 Overview

The Compliance Agent handles NIST 800-53 compliance assessments, remediation, evidence collection, RMF documentation, and security hardening **with a focus on ATO/RMF processes**.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Compliance Assessments**: NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, DoD IL scans mapped to control families
- **RMF Process Automation**: Evidence collection, eMASS package generation, POA&M creation
- **Control-Centric Remediation**: Fixes mapped to specific NIST controls (not just security findings)
- **ATO Package Preparation**: SSP, SAR, POA&M, Risk Assessment documents
- **Multi-Framework Support**: NIST 800-53 Rev 5, FedRAMP, DoD IL2/IL4/IL5/IL6
- **Defender Integration**: Leverages Azure Defender findings, maps to NIST controls

## 🔄 How This Differs from Defender for Cloud

| Feature | Defender for Cloud | Compliance Agent |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Security posture & threat detection | RMF/ATO compliance process |
| **Output** | Security alerts, recommendations | eMASS packages, POA&Ms, SSPs |
| **Control Mapping** | Azure Security Benchmark, CIS | NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, DoD IL |
| **Evidence Collection** | No | Yes (for ATO packages) |
| **Remediation** | Security-focused | Control-focused (AC-2, AU-3, SC-7) |
| **Integration** | Standalone | Orchestrates Defender + Policy + Advisor |

**Value Add:** This agent translates Azure security findings into compliance artifacts required for federal ATO processes.

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test compliance scan
curl -X POST http://localhost:5100/mcp/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Check NIST 800-53 compliance for subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}' | jq .
```

## 🧪 Test Cases by Function Category

### 1️⃣ Compliance Assessment Functions (3 functions)

#### Test COMP-1.1: Run Compliance Assessment (Control-Mapped)
