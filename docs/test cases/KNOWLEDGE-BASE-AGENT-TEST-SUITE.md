# Knowledge Base Agent Test Suite

**Last Updated:** November 13, 2025  
**Agent:** KnowledgeBase  
**Plugin Functions:** 18 total  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing of all Knowledge Base Agent capabilities

## 📋 Overview

The Knowledge Base Agent provides informational responses about compliance frameworks, NIST controls, STIGs, DoD instructions, and RMF processes. It does NOT perform assessments or scans - those are handled by the Compliance Agent.

**Key Differences:**
- **Knowledge Base Agent**: "What is...", "Explain...", "Show me...", "How does..." (informational queries)
- **Compliance Agent**: "Check...", "Scan...", "Assess...", "Validate..." (actual compliance scanning)

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test via MCP endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5100/mcp/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "YOUR_QUERY"}' | jq .

# Check orchestrator routing
docker logs plaform-engineering-copilot-mcp --since 2m | grep -E "(Plan created|Executing task with|agentType)"
```

---

### Test KB-8.3: Mixed Intent (Knowledge + Action)
```
Explain NIST AC-2 and scan my subscription for compliance
```
**Expected:** 
- First: KnowledgeBase explains AC-2
- Then: Orchestrator routes compliance scan to Compliance Agent
- Two-phase response

**Validation:**
- ✅ Knowledge question answered first
- ✅ Action request routed to correct agent
- ✅ Both responses provided

---

## 🚨 Anti-Patterns (Should NOT Work This Way)

### ❌ Test KB-9.1: Assessment Request to Knowledge Base
```
Check my subscription for NIST 800-53 compliance
```
**Expected:** Routes to **Compliance Agent**, NOT Knowledge Base Agent  
**Reason:** This is an assessment/scan, not informational

---

### ❌ Test KB-9.2: Resource Creation Request
```
Deploy infrastructure with NIST controls
```
**Expected:** Routes to **Infrastructure Agent**, NOT Knowledge Base Agent  
**Reason:** This is resource creation, not informational

---

## 📊 Validation Checklist

For each Knowledge Base Agent test, verify:

### Agent Routing
- [ ] `agentType: "KnowledgeBase"` in plan
- [ ] Only KnowledgeBase agent invoked (not Compliance, Infrastructure, etc.)
- [ ] Intent: "knowledge" (not "compliance", "infrastructure")

### Response Quality
- [ ] Informational response (not "scan started" or "resources created")
- [ ] Cites NIST, DoD, or STIG sources appropriately
- [ ] Provides actionable information
- [ ] No hallucinated data (accurate control IDs, STIG references)

### Performance
- [ ] Response time: 5-15 seconds (informational queries are fast)
- [ ] No unnecessary API calls
- [ ] Plugin function invoked (check logs for function name)

### Context Handling
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations maintain context
- [ ] No redundant questions
- [ ] Previous answers referenced appropriately

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: Generic Responses
**Problem:** Knowledge Base returns generic Azure docs instead of specific NIST/STIG info  
**Cause:** Agent not being invoked (routing to Infrastructure instead)  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (2025-11-13) - Added `"knowledgebase"` to ParseAgentType()

### Issue 2: Function Not Called
**Problem:** Agent invoked but plugin function not called  
**Cause:** Missing function in plugin or kernel  
**Check:** Look for function name in KnowledgeBasePlugin.cs

### Issue 3: Missing Data
**Problem:** "No STIG mapping found for control X"  
**Cause:** Knowledge base data incomplete  
**Solution:** Verify knowledge base services have data loaded

## 🎓 Testing Best Practices

1. **Test in Isolation:** Test Knowledge Base Agent separately from Compliance Agent
2. **Check Logs:** Always verify which agent was invoked via MCP logs
3. **Verify Functions:** Confirm the correct plugin function was called
4. **Context Matters:** Test multi-turn conversations to verify context handling
5. **Edge Cases:** Test invalid inputs, ambiguous requests, mixed intents
