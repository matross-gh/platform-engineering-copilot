                Recommendation = @"IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED per CA-2 (Security Assessments):

1. **Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud** (Automated Assessments):
   - Azure Portal → Microsoft Defender for Cloud → Environment settings
   - Select subscription → Defender plans → Enable all plans:
     - Defender for Servers ($15/VM/month): VM security posture, vulnerability scanning
     - Defender for App Service ($15/app/month): Web app vulnerabilities, threat detection
     - Defender for Storage ($10/storage account/month): Malware scanning, unusual access
     - Defender for SQL ($15/server/month): SQL vulnerability assessment, threat protection
     - Defender for Containers ($7/vCore/month): Container scanning, Kubernetes protection
     - Defender for Key Vault ($0.02/10K transactions): Key vault threat detection
     - Defender for DNS ($0.70/million queries): DNS anomaly detection
     - Defender for Resource Manager ($5/million operations): Control plane protection
   
   - **Benefits**:
     - 200+ automated security assessments (checks controls continuously)
     - Secure Score: Overall security posture (0-100%, target 80%+ for FedRAMP High)
     - Regulatory Compliance: FedRAMP High, NIST 800-53, DoD IL5 dashboards
     - Attack path analysis: Multi-step attack scenario identification
     - Security alerts: Real-time threat detection and incident response
   
   - **Cost**: Approximately 2-5% of total infrastructure cost

2. **Review Secure Score and Recommendations**:
   - Azure Portal → Defender for Cloud → Secure Score
   - Current score: X/100 points (lower score = more vulnerabilities)
   - **Target Scores**:
     - FedRAMP Moderate: 70% minimum
     - FedRAMP High: 80% minimum
     - DoD IL5: 90% minimum
   
   - Click each recommendation for details:
     - Affected resources (specific VMs, apps, storage accounts)
     - Remediation steps (automated fix-it button when available)
     - Impact on Secure Score (points gained by fixing)
     - Security control mapping (which NIST controls this addresses)
   
   - **Prioritize**:
     - High severity findings first (critical vulnerabilities)
     - Quick wins (high score impact, low effort)
     - Compliance gaps (FedRAMP/DoD specific requirements)

3. **Configure Regulatory Compliance Dashboard**:
   - Defender for Cloud → Regulatory compliance
   - Add compliance standards:
     - Azure Security Benchmark (enabled by default)
     - NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (FedRAMP baseline)
     - DoD Cloud Computing SRG (IL4/IL5)
     - PCI DSS 4.0 (if applicable)
     - CMMC Level 2 (DoD contractors)
   
   - **Review Compliance Status**:
     - Overall compliance percentage (target 90%+)
     - Failed assessments by control family (AC, AU, CM, etc.)
     - Passed assessments (evidence for SSP)
     - Not applicable assessments (document why)
   
   - Export compliance reports:
     - Download PDF/CSV reports (monthly for AO)
     - Share with assessors (3PAO or DIACAP)
     - Include in SSP as continuous monitoring evidence

4. **Deploy Azure Policy Initiatives**:
   - Azure Portal → Policy → Definitions → Initiatives
   - Assign built-in initiatives:
     - **Azure Security Benchmark**: Core security policies
     - **FedRAMP High**: FedRAMP-specific controls
     - **DoD Impact Level 5**: IL5 compliance policies
     - **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**: Full NIST control set
   
   - **Policy Effects**:
     - Audit: Report non-compliance (no enforcement)
     - Deny: Block non-compliant deployments (prevent misconfigurations)
     - DeployIfNotExists: Auto-remediate (e.g., deploy diagnostic settings)
     - Modify: Auto-fix configurations (e.g., add required tags)
   
   - Assign at subscription or resource group scope
   - Allow exclusions with documented justification (document in SSP)
   - Review compliance: Policy → Compliance (percentage by initiative)

5. **Conduct Independent Security Assessment**:
   - **FedRAMP**: Hire FedRAMP-approved Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)
   - **DoD**: Use DIACAP-certified assessor or DoD assessment team
   - **Commercial ATO**: Use qualified independent assessor
   
   - **Assessment Scope**:
     - Review all NIST 800-53 controls in SSP
     - Interview system owners and administrators
     - Test control implementations (sampling methodology per 800-53A)
     - Review evidence (logs, configurations, screenshots)
     - Validate compensating controls (if any deviations)
   
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Security Assessment Report (SAR): Formal findings
     - Security Assessment Plan (SAP): Assessment methodology
     - Risk Exposure Table: All identified risks
     - POA&M: Remediation plan for findings

6. **Develop Security Assessment Plan (SAP)**:
   - Document assessment methodology (per NIST 800-53A)
   - Define assessment objectives (verify control implementation)
   - Identify assessment team (lead assessor, technical assessors, SMEs)
   - Determine assessment methods:
     - **Examine**: Review documentation (SSP, policies, procedures)
     - **Interview**: Talk to system owners, admins, users
     - **Test**: Validate technical controls (vulnerability scans, penetration tests)
   
   - Define sampling strategy (if not testing 100% of controls)
   - Document assessment schedule (duration, milestones)
   - Coordinate with system owner (access, interviews, testing windows)

7. **Perform Control Testing** (per NIST 800-53A):
   - **Access Control (AC)**:
     - Test MFA enforcement (attempt login without MFA)
     - Review RBAC assignments (verify least privilege)
     - Test privileged access management (PIM approvals)
   
   - **Audit and Accountability (AU)**:
     - Review audit logs (verify comprehensive logging)
     - Test log integrity (verify tamper protection)
     - Validate alerting (trigger test alerts)
   
   - **Identification and Authentication (IA)**:
     - Test password policies (attempt weak passwords)
     - Verify managed identities (no hardcoded credentials)
     - Review session timeouts (test timeout enforcement)
   
   - **System and Communications Protection (SC)**:
     - Test encryption in transit (verify TLS 1.2+)
     - Verify encryption at rest (check storage/database encryption)
     - Test firewall rules (attempt blocked connections)
   
   - Document all test results (screenshots, logs, tool output)

8. **Generate Security Assessment Report (SAR)**:
   - **Executive Summary**: High-level findings, risk posture, ATO recommendation
   - **Assessment Methodology**: How controls were tested (examine/interview/test)
   - **Findings by Control Family**: 
     - Control ID and description
     - Assessment result (Satisfied, Other than Satisfied, Not Applicable)
     - Evidence reviewed (documentation, logs, configurations)
     - Weakness identified (if control not fully implemented)
     - Risk level (Low/Moderate/High based on likelihood × impact)
   - **Risk Exposure Table**: All findings with risk scores
   - **Recommendations**: Prioritized remediation actions
   - **Assessor Statement**: Independent verification of control effectiveness

9. **Create Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)**:
   - For each finding in SAR:
     - **Control ID**: Which NIST control has weakness
     - **Weakness**: Specific implementation gap
     - **Risk**: Likelihood × Impact (per NIST SP 800-30)
     - **Remediation**: Action items to close gap
     - **Resources Required**: Budget, personnel, time
     - **Scheduled Completion Date**: Target date for closure
     - **Milestones**: Interim steps (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
     - **Status**: Open, Ongoing, Risk Accepted, Closed
   
   - POA&M Template: Use FedRAMP POA&M template (required format)
   - Monthly Updates: Submit updated POA&M to AO (track progress)
   - Risk Acceptance: AO must formally accept all risks

10. **Implement Continuous Assessment Process**:
    - **Daily**: Defender for Cloud automated assessments
    - **Weekly**: Review new Defender recommendations (assign owners)
    - **Monthly**: Update POA&M, submit to AO, review Secure Score trends
    - **Quarterly**: 
      - Review Regulatory Compliance dashboard
      - Test incident response procedures
      - Conduct tabletop exercises (security scenarios)
      - Update risk assessment
    - **Annually**: 
      - Full independent security assessment (3PAO or assessor)
      - Update all SSP sections
      - Re-authorization decision by AO
      - Update contingency plan and test

                    Recommendation = @"IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED per CA-7 (Continuous Monitoring):

1. **Verify Diagnostic Settings on All Resources**:
   - Azure Portal → Monitor → Diagnostic settings
   - Filter by: Resources without diagnostic settings
   - For each resource type, configure appropriate log categories:
   
   **Key Vaults**:
   - Log category: AuditEvent (all operations: Get, List, Create, Delete)
   - Destination: Log Analytics workspace
   - Retention: 365 days minimum (FedRAMP), 730 days (DoD IL5)
   
   **Storage Accounts**:
   - Blob service: StorageRead, StorageWrite, StorageDelete

   **Network Security Groups**:
   - NetworkSecurityGroupEvent: NSG rule evaluations
   - NetworkSecurityGroupRuleCounter: Rule hit counts
   - Useful for: Identifying blocked traffic, security rule effectiveness
   
   **Virtual Machines**:
   - Install Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)
   - Data Collection Rules (DCR):
     - Windows: Security events, System events, Application events
     - Linux: Syslog (auth, authpriv, daemon, kern)
     - Performance counters (CPU, memory, disk, network)

2. **Configure Azure Policy for Automatic Diagnostic Settings**:
   - Azure Portal → Policy → Definitions
   - Search: 'Deploy Diagnostic Settings'
   - Assign policies:
     - 'Deploy Diagnostic Settings for Key Vault to Log Analytics workspace'
     - 'Deploy Diagnostic Settings for Storage to Log Analytics workspace'
     - 'Deploy Diagnostic Settings for SQL Databases to Log Analytics workspace'
     - 'Deploy Diagnostic Settings for Network Security Groups to Log Analytics workspace'
   
   - Policy effect: DeployIfNotExists (auto-configure new resources)
   - Remediation: Create remediation task (fix existing resources)
   - Benefits: Ensures all new resources automatically send logs

3. **Deploy Azure Monitor Agents** (VMs and VM Scale Sets):
   - Azure Portal → Virtual Machines → Extensions
   - Install: Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) - replaces legacy agents
   - Create Data Collection Rule (DCR):
     - Data sources: Windows Event Logs, Syslog, Performance counters
     - Destinations: Log Analytics workspace
     - Assign DCR to VMs
   
   - **Windows VMs**:

     - Application events: Error, Warning
   
   - **Linux VMs**:
     - Syslog: auth, authpriv (authentication), daemon, kern (kernel)
     - Facility severity: Notice, Warning, Error, Critical, Alert, Emergency
   
   - Use Azure Policy to auto-deploy agents:
     - 'Configure Linux virtual machines to run Azure Monitor Agent'
     - 'Configure Windows virtual machines to run Azure Monitor Agent'

4. **Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud** (If Not Already Enabled):
   - Azure Portal → Defender for Cloud → Environment settings
   - Enable all Defender plans (see CA-2 recommendations for details)
   - Configure continuous export:
     - Export to: Log Analytics workspace
     - Export: Security recommendations, Security alerts, Secure Score
     - Benefits: Historical trending, compliance reporting, SIEM integration

5. **Deploy Microsoft Sentinel** (SIEM for Advanced Threat Detection):
   - Azure Portal → Create Resource → Microsoft Sentinel
   - Select Log Analytics workspace (use existing)
   - Connect data sources:
     - **Azure Activity**: Subscription management operations
     - **Microsoft Entra ID**: Sign-ins, audit logs, identity risks
     - **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Security alerts and recommendations
     - **Azure Firewall**: Network traffic logs
     - **Office 365** (if applicable): Email, SharePoint, Teams activity
   
   - Enable analytics rules:
     - Built-in: Microsoft security templates (200+ rules)
     - Anomaly detection: Machine learning-based threat detection
     - Custom rules: KQL queries for specific threats
   
   - Configure automation playbooks:
     - Auto-respond to common incidents (block IP, disable user, notify team)
     - Logic Apps integration (ServiceNow, Slack, PagerDuty)
   
   - Cost: ~$2-$5/GB ingested (additional cost beyond Log Analytics)

6. **Configure Security Alerts and Action Groups**:
   - Azure Monitor → Alerts → Alert rules
   - Create alerts for critical events:
     - **High-Severity Defender Alerts**: Immediate notification
     - **Failed MFA Attempts**: 5+ failures in 30 minutes
     - **Privileged Role Activation**: PIM role assignment
     - **Key Vault Access Spike**: 10x normal access rate
     - **Storage Data Exfiltration**: Unusual download volume
     - **SQL Injection Attempts**: Defender for SQL alerts
   
   - Action Groups (who to notify):
     - Email: Security team, ISSO, ISSM
     - SMS: On-call engineer (critical alerts only)
     - Webhook: ServiceNow (create incidents automatically)
     - Azure Function: Custom auto-response logic
     - Logic App: Complex multi-step response workflows
   
   - Alert suppression: Prevent alert fatigue (group similar alerts)

7. **Implement Log Analytics Queries for Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Azure Portal → Log Analytics Workspace → Logs
   - Save queries for regular reviews:
   
   **Failed Authentication Attempts**:
   SigninLogs
   | where ResultType != 0
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
   | summarize FailedAttempts=count() by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, AppDisplayName
   | where FailedAttempts > 5
   | order by FailedAttempts desc
   
   **Key Vault Secret Access**:
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where ResourceType == 'VAULTS'
   | where OperationName == 'SecretGet'
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
   | summarize AccessCount=count() by CallerIPAddress, identity_claim_upn_s, ResourceId
   | order by AccessCount desc
   
   **Network Security Group Denials**:
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where Category == 'NetworkSecurityGroupRuleCounter'
   | where type_s == 'block'
   | summarize BlockedConnections=count() by NSGName_s, primaryIPv4Address_s, direction_s
   | order by BlockedConnections desc
   
   **SQL Authentication Failures**:
   AzureDiagnostics
   | where ResourceType == 'SERVERS'
   | where Category == 'SQLSecurityAuditEvents'
   | where statement_s contains 'LOGIN FAILED'
   | summarize FailedLogins=count() by server_principal_name_s, client_ip_s
   | order by FailedLogins desc

8. **Create Compliance Dashboards and Workbooks**:
   - Azure Portal → Monitor → Workbooks
   - Use templates or create custom:
     - **Security Overview**: Defender alerts, Secure Score, compliance percentage
     - **Authentication Monitoring**: Failed logins, MFA usage, risky sign-ins
     - **Resource Compliance**: Resources with/without diagnostic settings
     - **Incident Response**: Open incidents, MTTR (mean time to resolve), SLA compliance
   
   - Share with stakeholders:
     - ISSO/ISSM: Weekly security posture review
     - AO: Monthly compliance status
     - System Owner: Daily operational monitoring

9. **Configure Log Analytics Workspace Settings**:
   - Azure Portal → Log Analytics Workspace → Usage and estimated costs
   - **Retention**: 365 days minimum (FedRAMP requirement), 730 days (DoD IL5)
   - **Daily Cap**: Set limit to prevent unexpected costs (alert at 80%)
   - **Data Export**: Continuous export to Storage Account for long-term retention
   - **Access Control**: Reader role for security team, Contributor for admins
   - **Private Link**: Isolate workspace from public internet (IL5 requirement)

10. **Implement Continuous Monitoring Process** (CA-7):
    - **Daily** (Automated):
      - Defender for Cloud scans all resources (200+ assessments)
      - Sentinel analytics rules evaluate logs (detect threats)
      - Security alerts generated for suspicious activities
      - Automated playbooks respond to common incidents
    
    - **Daily** (Manual):
      - Review Defender for Cloud security alerts (triage and investigate)
      - Review Sentinel incidents (assign to analysts)
      - Check for new high/critical recommendations
    
    - **Weekly**:
      - Security team meeting: Review open incidents, discuss trends
      - Tune Sentinel analytics rules (reduce false positives)
      - Review failed authentication reports
      - Update firewall rules based on NSG logs
    
    - **Monthly**:
      - Generate compliance report (Regulatory Compliance dashboard)
      - Update POA&M with latest findings and progress
      - Submit monthly report to AO (required for FedRAMP/DoD)
      - Review Secure Score trends (track improvements)
      - Audit new resources (ensure diagnostic settings enabled)
    
    - **Quarterly**:
      - Update risk assessment (new threats, vulnerabilities)
      - Review control effectiveness (are controls working?)
      - Test incident response procedures (tabletop exercises)
      - Review and optimize Log Analytics costs (query optimization)
      - Update continuous monitoring strategy in SSP

CONTINUOUS MONITORING METRICS (Track in Monthly Reports):
- **Secure Score**: Target 80%+ (FedRAMP High), 90%+ (DoD IL5)
- **Compliance Percentage**: Target 95%+ for all assigned policies
- **Open Security Alerts**: Count by severity (trend should decrease)
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Target <1 hour for critical threats
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Target <4 hours for critical incidents
- **POA&M Items Closed**: Track remediation velocity
- **Resources with Diagnostic Settings**: Target 100%
- **Unresolved Vulnerabilities**: Count by severity, age

CONTINUOUS MONITORING REQUIREMENTS (FedRAMP/DoD):
- **Log Retention**: 365 days minimum (FedRAMP), 730 days (DoD IL5)
- **Monitoring Coverage**: 100% of system components (all resources)
- **Alert Response**: 15 minutes (critical), 1 hour (high), 4 hours (medium) per DoD SRG
- **Monthly Reporting**: Submit to AO (security posture, new findings, POA&M updates)
- **Annual Assessment**: Full control re-assessment by 3PAO or assessor
- **Significant Change**: Re-assessment for major system changes

COST OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- **Data Collection Rules**: Only collect logs you'll use (avoid verbose logging)
- **Log Analytics Commitment Tiers**: Prepay for 100GB+/day (30% discount)
- **Archive Tier**: Move old logs to low-cost storage (compliance retention)
- **Query Optimization**: Use time ranges, summarize early (reduce scanned data)
- **Alert Tuning**: Reduce false positives (save investigation time)
